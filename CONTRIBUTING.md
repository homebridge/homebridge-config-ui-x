# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome from everyone.

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) for the server and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the client UI.

## Getting Setup

*Note: The Raspberry Pi and similar boards do not meet the memory or CPU requirements required to setup the development environment.*

First, remove any globally installed versions of `homebridge-config-ui-x` you may have installed on your development machine:

```
npm uninstall -g homebridge-config-ui-x
```

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/homebridge-config-ui-x.git
```

Install npm dependencies for the plugin:

```
npm install
```

Install the npm dependencies for the UI:

```
npm run install:ui
```

Build the plugin, it may take sometime to compile the UI:

```
npm run build
```

Symlink your development directory to global:

```
npm link
```

If you don't have homebridge installed already run:

```
npm install -g homebridge
```

## Watching For Changes

This will start the Angular development server on port `4200` and a standalone server on port 8581. It will also watch and compile changes made to the server side TypeScript code:

```
npm run watch
```

You should now be able to navigate to `https://localhost:4200` in your browser which will connect to your `homebridge` instance running on port `8581`. The UI  will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.

## Running Tests

If you have made changes to the server side code, you should run the e2e test suite before creating a pull request:

```
npm run test
```
