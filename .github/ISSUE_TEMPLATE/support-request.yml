        Please read the following before you start filling out this form:

        * If your issue is specific to a certain plugin, create the issue on that plugin's GitHub project page instead.
        * Support via GitHub issues is limited. You may find it more beneficial ask questions on the [Homebridge Discord](https://discord.gg/kqNCe2D) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/) communities instead.
        * Search through existing issues (resolved or open) which might provide a solution to your problem already.
        * Aim to find a descriptive and precise title for your support request.
